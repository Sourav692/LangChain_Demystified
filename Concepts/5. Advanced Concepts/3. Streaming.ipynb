    "## Streaming in LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "All language model interfaces (LLMs) in LangChain implement the `Runnable` interface, which provides default methods such as `ainvoke`, `batch`, `abatch`, `stream`, and `astream`. This setup equips all LLMs with basic streaming capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Streaming Defaults:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Synchronous Streaming:** By default, streaming operations return an `Iterator` that yields a single value, the final result from the LLM provider.\n",
    "- **Asynchronous Streaming:** Similarly, async streaming defaults to returning an `AsyncIterator` with the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- These default implementations do not support token-by-token streaming. For such detailed streaming, the LLM provider must offer native support. However, the default setup ensures that your code expecting an iterator of tokens will function correctly within these constraints.\n"

      "A mortgage is a type of loan specifically used to purchase real estate, where the property itself serves as collateral for the loan. When a borrower takes out a mortgage, they agree to repay the loan amount, plus interest, over a specified period, typically 15 to 30 years. Mortgages are commonly used by individuals and families to buy homes, but they can also be used for investment properties or commercial real estate.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Components of a Mortgage\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Principal**: The original loan amount borrowed from the lender.\n",
      "2. **Interest Rate**: The cost of borrowing the principal, expressed as a percentage. This can be fixed (remains the same throughout the loan term) or variable (can change at specified times).\n",
      "3. **Term**: The length of time over which the loan must be repaid, commonly 15, 20, or 30 years.\n",
      "4. **Monthly Payments**: Typically consist of both principal and interest, and may also include property taxes and homeowners insurance (often referred to as PITI: Principal, Interest, Taxes, Insurance).\n",
      "5. **Down Payment**: The initial amount paid upfront by the borrower, usually expressed as a percentage of the property’s purchase price. A larger down payment can reduce the loan amount and may eliminate the need for private mortgage insurance (PMI).\n",
      "6. **Amortization**: The process of gradually paying off the loan through regular payments over the term of the mortgage.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Types of Mortgages\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Fixed-Rate Mortgage**: The interest rate remains constant throughout the life of the loan.\n",
      "2. **Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM)**: The interest rate may change at specified intervals based on market conditions.\n",
      "3. **Interest-Only Mortgage**: The borrower pays only the interest for a certain period, after which they begin paying both principal and interest.\n",
      "4. **FHA Loans**: Insured by the Federal Housing Administration, these loans are designed for low-to-moderate-income borrowers and require lower down payments.\n",
      "5. **VA Loans**: Available to veterans and active-duty military personnel, these loans often require no down payment and have favorable terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Pros of Mortgages\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Homeownership**: Mortgages enable individuals to purchase homes without needing the full purchase price upfront.\n",
      "2. **Building Equity**: As you make payments, you build equity in your home, which can be a valuable asset.\n",
      "3. **Tax Benefits**: Mortgage interest and property taxes may be tax-deductible, providing potential savings.\n",
      "4. **Fixed Payments**: With a fixed-rate mortgage, monthly payments remain stable, making budgeting easier.\n",
      "5. **Leverage**: Mortgages allow you to leverage your investment, meaning you can control a larger asset with a smaller amount of your own money.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Cons of Mortgages\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Debt Obligation**: A mortgage is a long-term debt that requires consistent payments, which can be a financial burden.\n",
      "2. **Interest Costs**: Over the life of the loan, the total interest paid can be substantial, often exceeding the principal amount borrowed.\n",
      "3. **Risk of Foreclosure**: If you fail to make payments, the lender can foreclose on the property, leading to loss of your home.\n",
      "4. **Market Fluctuations**: Property values can decrease, potentially leaving you with a mortgage that exceeds the home’s value (underwater mortgage).\n",
      "5. **Additional Costs**: Homeownership comes with other costs, such as maintenance, repairs, property taxes, and insurance, which can add to the financial burden.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "A mortgage can be a powerful tool for achieving homeownership and building wealth over time. However, it is essential to understand the responsibilities and risks involved. Prospective borrowers should carefully consider their financial situation, the terms of the mortgage, and the long-term implications of taking on such a significant debt. Consulting with financial advisors or mortgage professionals can help individuals make informed decisions."

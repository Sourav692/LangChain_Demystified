    "\n",
    "The beauty of `SQLChatMessageHistory` is that we can store separate conversation histories per user or session which is often the need for real-world chatbots which will be accessed by many users at the same time. Instead of in-memory we can store it in a SQL database which can be used to store a lot of conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a `get_session_history` function which is expected to take in a `session_id` and return a Message History object. Everything is stored in a SQL database. This `session_id` is used to distinguish between separate conversations, and should be passed in as part of the config when calling the new chain\n",
    "\n",
    "We also use a `memory_buffer_window` function to only use the top-K last historical conversations before sending it to the LLM, basically our own implementation of `ConversationBufferWindowMemory`"

    "- `ChatMessageHistory`: This is a class in LangChain that stores a sequence of chat messages (such as HumanMessage, AIMessage, SystemMessage) for a conversation. It allows you to append new messages and retrieve the full message history, which is useful for maintaining conversational context.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `BaseChatMessageHistory`: This is an abstract base class that defines the interface for chat message history storage backends. It specifies methods like add_message, get_messages, and clear, which concrete implementations (like ChatMessageHistory, RedisChatMessageHistory, etc.) must provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `RunnableWithMessageHistory`: This is a wrapper for a Runnable (such as a chain or LLM) that automatically manages message history for each session or user. It uses a function (like get_session_history) to retrieve the appropriate message history object based on a session ID, and injects the history into the chain's input. This enables multi-user or multi-session conversational experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `MessagesPlaceholder`: This is a special prompt template variable in LangChain that acts as a placeholder for a list of messages (e.g., the conversation history). When rendering a prompt, MessagesPlaceholder is replaced with the actual messages from history, allowing the LLM to see the full conversation context.\n"

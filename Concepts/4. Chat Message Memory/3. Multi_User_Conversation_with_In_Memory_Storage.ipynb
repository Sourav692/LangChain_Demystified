    "\n",
    "The concept of `ChatHistory` refers to a class in LangChain which can be used to wrap an arbitrary chain. This `ChatHistory` will keep track of inputs and outputs of the underlying chain, and append them as messages to a message database. Future interactions will then load those messages and pass them into the chain as part of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beauty of `ChatMessageHistory` is that we can store separate conversation histories per user or session which is often the need for real-world chatbots which will be accessed by many users at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a `get_session_history` function which is expected to take in a `session_id` and return a Message History object. Everything is stored in memory. This `session_id` is used to distinguish between separate conversations, and should be passed in as part of the config when calling the new chain"

    "- `ChatMessageHistory`: This is a class in LangChain that stores a sequence of chat messages (such as HumanMessage, AIMessage, SystemMessage) for a conversation. It allows you to append new messages and retrieve the full message history, which is useful for maintaining conversational context.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `BaseChatMessageHistory`: This is an abstract base class that defines the interface for chat message history storage backends. It specifies methods like add_message, get_messages, and clear, which concrete implementations (like ChatMessageHistory, RedisChatMessageHistory, etc.) must provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `RunnableWithMessageHistory`: This is a wrapper for a Runnable (such as a chain or LLM) that automatically manages message history for each session or user. It uses a function (like get_session_history) to retrieve the appropriate message history object based on a session ID, and injects the history into the chain's input. This enables multi-user or multi-session conversational experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `MessagesPlaceholder`: This is a special prompt template variable in LangChain that acts as a placeholder for a list of messages (e.g., the conversation history). When rendering a prompt, MessagesPlaceholder is replaced with the actual messages from history, allowing the LLM to see the full conversation context.\n"

These networks are designed to automatically learn representations of data, making them particularly effective for tasks like image and speech recognition.\n",

For example, in image recognition, initial layers might detect edges, while deeper layers identify shapes and objects. This hierarchical learning enables the model to understand intricate patterns without manual feature extraction.\n",

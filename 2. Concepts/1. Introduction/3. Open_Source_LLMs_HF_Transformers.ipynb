    "## 📝 Summary & Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hugging Face Transformers** provides easy access to thousands of pre-trained models\n",
    "2. **Loading models** requires two components: **Tokenizer** + **Model**\n",
    "3. **Chat templates** format messages correctly for each model family\n",
    "4. **Manual workflow**: encode → generate → decode\n",
    "5. **Pipelines** simplify everything into a single function call\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Code Patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Loading a model and tokenizer\n",
    "from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\n",
    "tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"model_id\")\n",
    "model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"model_id\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using pipelines (recommended for simplicity)\n",
    "pipe = transformers.pipeline(\"text-generation\", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)\n",
    "response = pipe([{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Your question\"}])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 When to Use Each Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Approach | Use Case |\n",
    "|----------|----------|\n",
    "| **Manual** (encode/generate/decode) | Fine-grained control, custom generation logic |\n",
    "| **Pipeline** | Quick prototyping, standard use cases |\n",
    "| **API/Cloud** (Groq, HF Inference) | No local GPU, production deployments |\n",

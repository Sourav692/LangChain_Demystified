    "## LangChain Agents - A Comprehensive Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Agents?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agents** are one of the most powerful concepts in LangChain. Unlike simple chains that follow a predetermined sequence, agents use an LLM as a **reasoning engine** to dynamically determine:\n",
    "1. **Which actions** to perform\n",
    "2. **In what order** to perform them\n",
    "3. **When to stop** and return a final answer\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "| Concept | Description |\n",
    "|---------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Agent** | The decision-maker that uses an LLM to reason about what to do next |\n",
    "| **Tools** | Functions that agents can call to interact with the external world |\n",
    "| **Agent Executor** | The runtime that orchestrates the agent's reasoning and tool execution loop |\n",
    "| **Scratchpad** | Memory of previous actions and observations within a single run |\n",
    "\n",
    "### The ReAct Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "Most agents follow the **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)** pattern:\n",
    "1. **Thought**: The agent reasons about what to do\n",
    "2. **Action**: The agent decides which tool to use\n",
    "3. **Action Input**: The input to pass to the tool\n",
    "4. **Observation**: The result from the tool\n",
    "5. **Repeat** until the agent has enough information to provide a final answer\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚠️ **Note**: LangChain is transitioning to **LangGraph** for building agents. However, understanding these concepts is still valuable as they form the foundation."

    "## Section 1: Understanding Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Tools?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tools** are functions that agents can use to interact with the external world. They extend the agent's capabilities beyond just generating text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type | Examples | Use Case |\n",
    "|------|----------|----------|\n",
    "| **Built-in Tools** | `llm-math`, `wikipedia`, `serpapi` | Common utilities provided by LangChain |\n",
    "| **Custom Tools** | Your own functions | Domain-specific operations |\n",
    "| **Chain Tools** | Other LangChain chains | Complex multi-step operations |\n",
    "| **Agent Tools** | Other agents | Hierarchical agent systems |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tool Components\n",
    "\n",
    "Every tool has:\n",
    "- **name**: A unique identifier for the tool\n",
    "- **description**: Explains what the tool does (crucial for the agent to decide when to use it!)\n",
    "- **func**: The actual function that gets executed\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 **Pro Tip**: The `description` is extremely important! The agent uses it to decide which tool to use. Make it clear and specific."

    "\n",
    "### What We Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agents** use LLMs as reasoning engines to decide which tools to use\n",
    "2. **Tools** extend agent capabilities with domain-specific functions\n",
    "3. **ReAct Pattern** (Thought → Action → Observation) is the foundation\n",
    "4. **Custom Tools** can be created by subclassing `BaseTool`\n",
    "5. **Conversational Agents** maintain memory across multiple turns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent Types Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "| Agent Type | Memory | Best For |\n",
    "|------------|--------|----------|\n",
    "| `ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION` | ❌ | One-off questions |\n",
    "| `CHAT_CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION` | ✅ | Multi-turn chat |\n",
    "| `OPENAI_FUNCTIONS` | Optional | Reliable tool calling |\n",
    "| `STRUCTURED_CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION` | ❌ | Complex tool inputs |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tool Descriptions Matter**: Write clear, specific descriptions\n",
    "2. **Handle Errors**: Use `handle_parsing_errors=True`\n",
    "3. **Set Limits**: Use `max_iterations` to prevent infinite loops\n",
    "4. **Choose Right Agent**: Match agent type to your use case\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explore **LangGraph** for more advanced agent workflows\n",
    "- Learn about **Agent Tool Calling** with OpenAI Functions\n",
    "- Build **Multi-Agent Systems** for complex tasks\n",

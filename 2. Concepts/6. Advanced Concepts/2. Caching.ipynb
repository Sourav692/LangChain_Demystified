    "\n",
    "LangChain includes an optional caching layer for language model APIs (LLMs). This caching feature is beneficial for two main reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cost Efficiency:** By caching responses, you reduce the number of API calls made to LLM providers, especially helpful if you are frequently requesting the same completions. This can significantly lower costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Performance Improvement:** Caching can enhance your application's speed by decreasing the need for repeated API calls to the LLM provider, making interactions quicker and more efficient.\n"

    "In this notebook, we'll learn how to interact with popular **Commercial Large Language Model (LLM) APIs** directly using their official Python SDKs — **without any abstraction layers like LangChain**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Learn Native API Access?\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding native API access is crucial because:\n",
    "1. **Foundation Knowledge**: It helps you understand what happens \"under the hood\" when using higher-level frameworks\n",
    "2. **Debugging**: When things go wrong, knowing the native API helps you troubleshoot effectively\n",
    "3. **Flexibility**: Some advanced features may only be available through native APIs\n",
    "4. **Performance**: Direct API calls can sometimes be more efficient for simple use cases\n",

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explored how to use commercial LLM APIs **natively** (without frameworks like LangChain):\n",
    "\n",
    "### OpenAI GPT\n",
    "- Uses the `openai` Python library\n",
    "- Requires a **paid API key** with billing set up\n",
    "- Uses a **messages array** structure with roles (system, user, assistant)\n",
    "- Main method: `openai.chat.completions.create()`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Google Gemini\n",
    "- Uses the `google-generativeai` Python library\n",
    "- Offers a **free tier** for learning and experimentation\n",
    "- Simpler API structure with `GenerativeModel` class\n",
    "- Main method: `model.generate_content()`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison Quick Reference\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | OpenAI | Gemini |\n",
    "|---------|--------|--------|\n",
    "| Import | `import openai` | `import google.generativeai as genai` |\n",
    "| Configure | `openai.api_key = key` | `genai.configure(api_key=key)` |\n",
    "| API Call | `openai.chat.completions.create()` | `model.generate_content()` |\n",
    "| Response | `response.choices[0].message.content` | `response.text` |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Practice**: Try different prompts with both APIs\n",
    "2. **Experiment**: Change the `temperature` parameter and observe how outputs vary\n",
    "3. **Compare**: Test the same prompt across different models\n",
    "4. **Move On**: Learn how to use these same LLMs with **LangChain** in the next notebook!\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🎯 **Coming Up Next**: In `2. Commercial_LLMs_with_LangChain.ipynb`, we'll see how LangChain simplifies working with these APIs and provides powerful abstractions for building LLM applications.\n"
